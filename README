This is an exercise done as homework for Code Fellows' Foundation II: iOS Development class.  The instructions were as below:

1) Create a new single view application in Xcode
2) Add a button in the storyboard that logs a message to the console when it is tapped.
3) Add a UISwitch to your view controller and println() a message to the console when it is toggled.
4) Add a UISlider to your view controller and println() a message to the console with the current slider value, but only when the value is greater than 0.5

Challenge:

Add a second view controller, and a second button. Use a segue to present the second view controller when the button is tapped.
